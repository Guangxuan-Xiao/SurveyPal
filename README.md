# SurveyPal

SurveyPal is a helper for researchers to find related papers.

## Motivation

Have you ever spend great effort on your extraordinary ideas, doing experiment and writing papers, but discover your idea have been researched after all these. Though I have only started researching shortly, I have already experienced this several times. Thus I want to develop a recommender system of papers, of which inputs and outputs are both papers.

SurveyPal is based on natural language processing and graph representation learning techniques. Researchers enter a list of papers which they are interested in, and the system will give a more comprehensive list of related papers. Therefore, this system can boost the process of surveying and prevent the tragedy that previously metioned.
